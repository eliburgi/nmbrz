Mobile app written in Dart using the Flutter SDK. This app is cross-platform, i.e. it can be published for Android and iOS. 

The app displays random facts about numbers, years or dates using http://numbersapi.com/. 
The user can also search for specific numbers or dates (dialogs were not learning focus of this app though ... :)).
Sharing facts via WhatsApp, SMS, etc. isn´t implemented yet, so feel free to do so ;)

Main learning focus for me (by developing this app) :
- using Dart´s http and async libraries for making API calls
- getting to know the different flutter widgets better 
- of course, the design should be simple but attracting (I really enjoy coming up with different designs :))
- get a feel for developing apps using flutter (it´s different than classical Android development using Java/Kotlin, more like React Native)
